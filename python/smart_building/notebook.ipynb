    "\n",
    "Large commercial buildings are often so large that they require pre-heating and pre-cooling to achieve an appropriate temperature for either the occupants or the equipment inside. These buildings can be anything from office buildings, warehouses, or even GPU data centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, setting the right HVAC system settings is challenging because it requires predicting the future temperature and energy usage of the building. Current approaches either use simple heuristics or machine learning models to predict the future temperature and energy usage. In this demo, we'll show how these approaches fail to provide accurate predictions and waste both energy and money."

    "\n",
    "The usual approach to solving the problem of choosing the correct HVAC settings for a building is to use a historical dataset relating to the building. The dataset might usually contain the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `day`: The day of the year, indexed from 1 to 365\n",
    "- `outdoor_temp`: The temperature outside the building\n",
    "- `energy`: The overall energy usage of the building\n",
    "- `heating`: The heating setting of the HVAC system\n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo we'll use a synthetic dataset. This allows us to simulate the impact of taking actions by changing the HVAC settings and observing the impact on the indoor temperature. This is usually not possible in a real-world dataset, and is the reason that standard AI/ML tools fail to solve this problem.\n",
