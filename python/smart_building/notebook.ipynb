Current approaches either use simple heuristics or machine learning models to predict the future temperature and energy usage.

    "This notebook is a short introduction to how CausaDB can be used in smart building energy management. We've built an accompanying Streamlit app to demonstrate how CausaDB can be used to optimise HVAC settings in real time in a deployed system. Check out the application code in the `app.py` file and test out the live app by visiting [causadb-examples-smart-building.streamlit.app](https://causadb-examples-smart-building.streamlit.app/).\n",

    "CausaDB is not just for HVAC systems. The same principles can be applied to a wide range of problems in domains as diverse as marketing, logistics, healthcare, and more. To find out more about CausaDB and to get in touch, visit our site at [causa.tech](https://causa.tech)."
